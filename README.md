# Bloodhound-CustomQueries
Custom Queries - Brought Up to BH4.1 syntax.

A combination of custom cypher queries from various sources for [Bloodhound](https://github.com/BloodHoundAD/BloodHound), added categories to match newest version of BH. Some queries are straight from sources below however others are curated from all over. If you have others to add, just open a pull request and add the thanks to the list.
